"""The command line interface for ratvec.

Why does this file exist, and why not put this in ``__main__``?
You might be tempted to import things from ``__main__`` later, but that will cause
problems--the code will get executed twice:

- When you run `python3 -m ratvec` python will execute
  ``__main__.py`` as a script. That means there won't be any
  ``ratvec.__main__`` in ``sys.modules``.
- When you import ``__main__`` it will get executed again (as a module) because
  there's no ``ratvec.__main__`` in ``sys.modules``.
